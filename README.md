# Building A Chatbot Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Goal
* Learn how to crawl a large amount of data using Scrapy & BeautifulSoup
* Learn how to transform the data optimally
* Compare the performance of different LLM models

## Step 1: Planning
| Step | Objective | Library/Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Data Crawling | Scrapy or BeautifulSoup |
| 2 | Data Transformation (Vector-based) | Word2Vec, BERT, TF-IDF Vectorization (sklearn) |
| 3 | Choose an LLM model | OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, LlamaIndex |
| 4 | Retrieval Techniques & Query Engines | Elasticsearch |
| 5 | Optimization | Pinecone |
| 6 | Evaluation | Accuracy & Relevance |

## Notes (Things I find helpful to keep in mind)
* Web scraping is **extract and download** content from a webpage and the data is saved to the local machine. On the other hand, web crawling uses a web scrawler or spider to **index** web pages.
