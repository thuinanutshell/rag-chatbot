# Building A Chatbot Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
## Overall Goal
Develop a RAG chatbot with a database of my favorite Substack articles. Two of them are written in English and the other two are written in Vietnamese. I want to build a hybrid model using both English LLM and Vietnamese LLM to question-answer from this database:
