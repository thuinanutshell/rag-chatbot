## Goal
* Learn how to crawl a large amount of data using Scrapy & BeautifulSoup
* Learn how to transform the data optimally
* Compare the performance of different LLM models

## Step 1: Planning
| Step | Objective | Library/Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Data Crawling | Scrapy or BeautifulSoup |
| 2 | Data Transformation (Vector-based) | Word2Vec, BERT, TF-IDF Vectorization (sklearn) |
| 3 | Choose an LLM model | OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, LlamaIndex |
| 4 | Retrieval Techniques & Query Engines | Elasticsearch |
| 5 | Optimization | Pinecone |
| 6 | Evaluation | Accuracy & Relevance |

## Step 2: Data Preparation


## Step 3: Data Transformation

## Step 4: Integrate LLM APIs

## Step 5: Optimization

## Step 6: Evaluation

## Key Learnings
